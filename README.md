Visualizing the Crisis
======================

This repository contains the results and the complete documentation of the MA Information Design Laboratory held at [Universit√† IUAV di Venezia] (http://www.iuav.it), between February and June 2016. The course was a 15-week-long design workshop within the department of Design and Planning in Complex Environments, and was attended by both first- and second-year students of the MA Comunication Design, during the academic year 2015-2016.

The course was established as an ongoing, real-time data-visualisation workshop with the intention to track and explain the forecast global financial crisis that was supposed to happen in 2016. The purpose of the work was to provide context to this evolving crisis, looking at the broader socio-political context within the financial landscape take shape, with the intention to find a richer visual languagefort e explanation of these apparently abstract phenomena. The students were divided into seven groups (corresponding to various and relevant topics) and were asked to track the evolving news form the perspective of their area. The groups are outlined below. You can find [here] a longer introduction to the issues and methodology of the workshop.

#### Groups
The groups are seven: __Central Banking__, __Employment__, __Energy__, __EU Debt Crisis__, __Gold__, __Real Estate__, __Tech Bubble__. You can find a concise introduction to each of the topics in this text file. 

#### Outputs
The course had two main outputs: a series of __10 weekly bulletins__ (spanning from March 5th, 2016 to May 14th, 2016), double-sided A3 and printed with a [Risograph] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risograph) machine. An __interactive installation__ that allows for the exploration of the complete archive of information collected within the four months of work, and browsable through a series of 64 keywords. On June 24th, on the occasione of the student's final show at IUAV, Venice, this installation was presented through a physical interface made of punched cards (for the selectin of the keyowrds), a punched card reader and a thermal printer for the output of the resulting report. A similar interface, but digital, producing similar reports can be found here. The machine wroks with a series of XML files that collect all the ifnormation contained in the printed bulletins.

#### Methodology and Organization
Data visualization
Responsive design
Separation of form and contents

The course has been run on [Slack] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)). 


#### Credits
First and foremost, the credits go to the students that were part of this workshop, and that painstackingly worked for the whole span of the course researching their field of interest, refining their visual languages and then switching to code for the translation of all the contents into the XML machine. Here is the list of them, organized by group: 

* __Central Banking__: Giulia Fracas, Francesca Polini
* __Employment__: Daniela Bracco, Ilaria Gava, Andrea Marson
* __Energy__: Eleonora Di Bartolo, Serena Montefiori, Maria Tollot
* __EU Debt Crisis__: Francesca Alaimo, Jacopo Faggian, Valeria Mento
* __Gold__: Noemi Incardona, Fabiana Mangano, Alessandra Neri
* __Real Estate__: Irene Chiappini, Giulia Serafin
* __Tech Bubble__: Elisa Bianchi, Francesca Luzi, Federico Rita

The course has been led by professors __Marco Ferrari__ and __Ivor Williams__, together with __Giacomo Covacich__, __Pietro Leoni__ and __Angelo Semeraro__ as tutors.

__Angelo Semeraro__ developed the back-end and the front-end of the interactive installation, its digital interface and all the tools that helped the students to translate their bulletins into open-source, XML repositories. 

__Pietro Leoni__ designed and programmed the punched card reader. 

__Giacomo Covacich__ took care of the printing process with the Risograph machine.
