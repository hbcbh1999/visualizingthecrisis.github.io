Visualizing the Crisis
======================

##### An Information Design Workshop to track the unfolding global financial crisis.

This repository collects the results and the complete documentation of the __MA Information Design Laboratory__ that took place at [Università IUAV di Venezia] (http://www.iuav.it) between February and June 2016. The course was planned as a 15-week design workshop within the department of Design and Planning in Complex Environments, and was attended by both first- and second-year students of the MA Communication Design, during the academic year 2015-2016.

The lab was established as an ongoing, real-time data-visualisation attempt to track and explain the new global financial crisis that many analists predicted for 2016. The aim of the workshop has been to better understand the implications and provide context to this looming crisis, by looking at the broader socio-political context in which every financial turmoil unfolds. From a design perspective, the intention was to develop new ways for the representation of the economical data, in order to render the rather flat language of graphs and report into a richer visual landscape of different elements.

The students have been divided into __seven groups__, each of them each of them covering a specific and relevant topic, and listed below. They were asked to follow the news and get an insight view over their respective areas, in order to investigate patterns, organize data and stories and being able to track the shifts in this financial global landscape.

You can find [here] a longer introduction to the issues and methodology of the workshop.

## Methodology and Organization
Data visualization
Responsive design

Separation of form and contents

The course  was run in weekly classes, 8-hour per day, between February 22nd and June 24th, 2016. The course has been run on [Slack] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)) and here, on Github, during its whole duration, in order to track the progress of the work, review the output and organize the various steps of the process. 

## Groups
The groups are seven: __Central Banking__, __Employment__, __Energy__, __EU Debt Crisis__, __Gold__, __Real Estate__, __Tech Bubble__. You can find a concise introduction to each of the topics in this text file. 

## Outputs
The course had two main outputs: a series of __10 weekly bulletins__ (spanning from March 5th, 2016 to May 14th, 2016), double-sided A3 and printed with a [Risograph] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risograph) machine. An __interactive installation__ that allows for the exploration of the complete archive of information collected within the four months of work, and browsable through a series of 64 keywords. On June 24th, on the occasione of the student's final show at IUAV, Venice, this installation was presented through a physical interface made of punched cards (for the selectin of the keyowrds), a punched card reader and a thermal printer for the output of the resulting report. A similar interface, but digital, producing similar reports can be found here. The machine wroks with a series of XML files that collect all the ifnormation contained in the printed bulletins.

## Credits
First and foremost, the credit goes to the students that were part of this workshop, and that painstackingly worked for the whole span of the course researching their field of interest, refining their visual languages and then switching to code for the translation of all the contents into the XML machine. Here is the list of them, organized by group: 

* __Central Banking__: Giulia Fracas, Francesca Polini
* __Employment__: Daniela Bracco, Ilaria Gava, Andrea Marson
* __Energy__: Eleonora Di Bartolo, Serena Montefiori, Maria Tollot
* __EU Debt Crisis__: Francesca Alaimo, Jacopo Faggian, Valeria Mento
* __Gold__: Noemi Incardona, Fabiana Mangano, Alessandra Neri
* __Real Estate__: Irene Chiappini, Giulia Serafin
* __Tech Bubble__: Elisa Bianchi, Francesca Luzi, Federico Rita

The course has been led by professors [__Marco Ferrari__] (https://twitter.com/mariofaranda) and [__Ivor Williams__] (https://twitter.com/ivorinfo), together with __Giacomo Covacich__, __Pietro Leoni__ and __Angelo Semeraro__ as tutors.

__Angelo Semeraro__ developed the back-end and the front-end of the interactive installation, its digital interface and all the tools that helped the students to translate their bulletins into open-source, XML repositories. __Pietro Leoni__ designed and programmed the punched card reader. __Giacomo Covacich__ took care of the printing process of the A3 bulletins with the Risograph machine. 

Thank you to Alessandro Busi, Aaron Gillett for visiting during the midterm reviews; Hugo Liu for his advice during definition of the course's structure.
