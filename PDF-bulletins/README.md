The printed bulletins
=====================

This folder collects the PDF files of all the A3 bulletins edited and designed over the course of ten weeks, between March 5th and May 14th, 2016. They are organized in sub-folders, corresponding to each research group. The bulletins have been printed with a Risograph machine in a limited edition of 40 copies for the lab's final show at IUAV, Venice, on June 24th, 2016 (photos [here] (../photos/)).

The elements thatappear in all the bulletins are a header (containing a proper name for the publication); a sequential numbering of the issues; the date of publication (every Saturday); a colophon with the name of the authors, sources of all the information contained in the issue, data about the typeface used, and n academic reference. Every bulletin keeps the same typeface throughout the issues: the students could initially choose between a selection of fonts provided by [CAST] (http://c-a-s-t.com), a digital type foundry based in Bolzano, Italy. The typefaces are: Brasilica, Brevier (chosen by [__Central Banking__] (central-banking/)), Dic Sans ([__EU Debt Crisis__] (euro-debt-crisis/), [__Real Estate__] (real-estate/)), Divenire, Gramma ([__Employment__] (employment/), [__Energy__] (energy/), [__Gold__] (gold/), [__Tech Bubble__] (tech-bubble/)), Macho, Saffran and Zenon. 

The students researched and collectively edited all the information contained in the bulletins. As an initial design choice, the the content was limited to text and vector diagrams and illustrations, asking the students to design everything that was going into them. Design possibilities were even further narrowed down by curbing the color palette to just three colours: black, red and green (this also to cope with the printing limitations of the Risograph machine).

The progressive bulletins shows the evolution of the design grammar and language of each group.
