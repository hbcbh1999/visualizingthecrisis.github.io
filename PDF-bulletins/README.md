The printed bulletins
=====================

This folder collects the PDF files of all the A3 bulletins edited and designed over the course of ten weeks, between March 5th and May 14th, 2016. They are organized in sub-folders, corresponding to each research topic. The bulletins have been printed with a Risograph machine in a limited edition of 40 copies for the lab's final show at IUAV, Venice, on June 24th, 2016 (photos [here] (../photos/)).

Every bulletin contains a recurring series of elements: a header (with the name for each publication); sequential numbering of the single issues; date of publication; a colophon with the name of the authors; the sources of all the information contained in the issue. Each bulletin keeps the same typeface throughout its 10 issues. The students initially chose between a selection of fonts provided by [CAST] (http://c-a-s-t.com), a digital type foundry based in Bolzano, Italy. These typefaces are: Brasilica, Brevier (chosen by [__Central Banking__] (central-banking/)), Dic Sans ([__EU Debt Crisis__] (euro-debt-crisis/), [__Real Estate__] (real-estate/)), Divenire, Gramma ([__Employment__] (employment/), [__Energy__] (energy/), [__Gold__] (gold/), [__Tech Bubble__] (tech-bubble/)), Macho, Saffran and Zenon. 

The students researched and collectively edited all the information contained in the bulletins. As a fundamental design decision, the content was limited to text, vector diagrams and illustrations, requiring the students to design everything that appears on the publications. Design possibilities were further refined down by curbing the color palette to just three options: black, red and green (which also supported the printing limitations of the Risograph machine).

The complete series of all the bulletins reflects the evolution of the emerging design grammar and language of each group, throughout the overall 15 weeks of work.
