The printed bulletins
=====================

This folder collects the PDF files of all the A3 bulletins edited and designed over the course of ten weeks, between March 5th and May 14th, 2016. They are organized in sub-folders, corresponding to each research group. The bulletins have been printed with a Risograph machine in a limited edition of 40 copies for the lab's final show at IUAV, Venice, on June 24th, 2016 (photos [here] (../photos/)).

All the bulletins contain the following elements: header (containing a proper name for the publication); sequential numbering of the issues; the date of publication (every Saturday); colophon with the name of the authors; sources of all the information contained in the issue; data about the typeface used and an academic reference. Every bulletin maintains the same typeface throughout the 10 issues. The students could initially choose between a selection of fonts provided by [CAST] (http://c-a-s-t.com), a digital type foundry based in Bolzano, Italy. The typefaces are: Brasilica, Brevier (chosen by [__Central Banking__] (central-banking/)), Dic Sans ([__EU Debt Crisis__] (euro-debt-crisis/), [__Real Estate__] (real-estate/)), Divenire, Gramma ([__Employment__] (employment/), [__Energy__] (energy/), [__Gold__] (gold/), [__Tech Bubble__] (tech-bubble/)), Macho, Saffran and Zenon. 

The students researched and collectively edited all the information contained in the bulletins. As an fundamental design decision, the content was limited to text, vector diagrams and illustrations, requiring the students to design everything that would be compiled. Design possibilities were further refined down by curbing the color palette to just three colours: black, red and green (which supported the printing limitations of the Risograph machine).

Each bulletins demonstrates the subsequent evolution of the emerging design grammar and language of each group.
