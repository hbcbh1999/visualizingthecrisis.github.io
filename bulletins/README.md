The XML bulletins
=================

Contained in this folder is the complete archive of the 70 bulletins, organised into their respective groups from issue 1 to 10, formatted into XML bulletins.

These XML files represent the deconstruction of information gathered by the students, into a readable format that is pulled into an interface that can be viewed online [here], or processed through a card reader and outputted to a thermal printer during the closing exhbition at IUAV University on the June 24th.

The dense information graphics designed by the students are reduced to their essential elements, broken down into component atoms. Consisting of graph and chart boxes, titles, sub-titles, text, reference and citations, they are drawn together to create data molecules that are easily outputted digitally. 

The syntax of the XML bulletins are such that they are both readable to the layman but suitable for machine output, itself an exercise in informational clarity. The student cohort collectively devised and agreed upon a system of 64 keywords that categorised the world, so that information could be easily cross-referenced, compared and contrasted. They range from geographies, resources, population types, financial definitions and industries. The complete list can be viewed [here].
