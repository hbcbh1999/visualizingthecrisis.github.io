        <title>Did you know? Eight curiosities about gold</title>
        <chapter>
        <paragraph>
          The gold symbol in the periodic table is Au, because it comes from the Latin “aurum”, which means shining dawn,
          aurora. A term more than fair for this metal.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>
            The largest nugget of history is called “Welcome Stranger”, and was found in 1869 by two miners.
            It weighed 71 kilograms and measured 10x25 inches.</paragraph><paragraph>For over 70 years the standard treatment for
            rheumatoid arthritis consisted of injections of a liquid suspension of gold, which acted as an anti-inflammatory.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>
              In an iPhone 5, there are about 0.03 grams of gold. All our hi-tech devices contain a small amount of the precious metal.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>
                The largest gold coin measures 80 cm in diameter and was created by the Perth Mint in 2012: worth 870, 000
                euro. It has the image of a kangaroo.</paragraph><paragraph>According to a study of the University of Bristol,
                gold and platinum would be rained down from the sky 4 billion years ago, thanks to a bombardment of meteorites.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>
                  49% of gold extracted from the mines is used in jewelry. And approximately 20% used for
                  decorative purposes, is located in a sari, Indian women's garments</paragraph><paragraph>Even the human body has
                  dissolved gold on the inside, even if the amount is so small that even considering the whole human race would remain microscopic.</paragraph>

          After identifying an underground reservoir, it blows up the soil through a process called "overburden" rather
          than digging underground wells. After identifying an underground reservoir,

         <title>The extraction phase</title>
         <paragraph>
           Two-thirds of the gold extracted came from the immense open-pit mines.
           These are opened with a process called “overburden”. This type of mines involves the cancellation of the surronding landscape,
           and the production of rubble, 8-10 times higher than underground miners.
           </paragraph>
         <paragraph>
            In a mine there are about 3,000 workers.
            Especially in African artisanal mines, miners work in very poor conditions, with shifts up to 24
            hours and with no protection for emissions of toxic substances.
            Much of the miners are children between 8 and 17 years exploited.</paragraph>
         <paragraph>
              The rubble is generally piled into enormous mounds, some of them reaching heights of 100 meters.</paragraph>

         <title>The purify phase</title>
         <paragraph>
           Gold is extracted with a process called “heap leacing”, the rock is crushed, piled into huge heaps
           and sprayed with cyanide. 1 microgram per liter of cyanide is fatal for fishes.
           The tubs in which the gold is purified contain water (500 part per million), cyanide (100 part per million) and rocks.

         <paragraph>
              Tailings, a by-product of extraction, are discharged in a dam. There have been over 221 major tailings dam failures.
              These have killed hundreds of people, displaced thousands and contaminated the drinking water of millions. Toxic mine waste contains
              dangerous chemicals including: arsenic, lead, mercury, petroleum byproducts, acids, cyanide.
              The sulfuric acid produced by the sterile waste is 200/300 times more concetrated then in acid rain.</paragraph>
         <paragraph>
             To further purify the gold from other metals ,it is required the fusion at high temperatures.
             The fusion adds about 142 million tons of sulfur dioxide each year, this is the 13% of the global total the emission.</paragraph>

              <title>The environment</title>
              <paragraph>
                The resulting of mine processes is a set of toxic product that invade the environment,
                the so called acid mine drenage (AMD). It involves local comunities closes to mines and natural closes to mines.
                AMD's byproducts such as mercury and heavy metals work their way into the food chain and sicken people and animals for generations.
             </paragraph>
             <paragraph>
                 AMD has sirius impact specially on water destroying biological habitats such as coral reefs
                 and aquatic life. Into rivers and oceans are discharged around 2,100 tons of mining waste a day
                 also forming artificial beaches. The coastal ocean waters are the biologically richest parts of the ocean,
                 many open ocean species depend on coastal habitats.</paragraph>

       <title>The green gold, a sustainable choice</title>
       <chapter>
        <paragraph>
          Ethical gold means the gold mined by non-invasive techniques , that is, without the use of methods considered harmful both for the environment
           and for the communities situated closes to the reservoirs, such as, highly polluting chemical agents or explosives.
          It constitutes one of the most effective solutions in this aspect, so much to be been renamed gold green!</paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            Its production, takes place according to the regulations relating to safety and to work, protecting, those who have to
            operate in hazardous conditions and avoiding the phenomenon of child labor exploitation.
            Fairtrade, a no profit organization are working to ensure that even the gold market will become more ethical.</paragraph>
