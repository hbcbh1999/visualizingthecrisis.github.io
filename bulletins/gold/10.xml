          <title>Vatican's Sacred Gold</title>
          <chapter>
          <paragraph>
            When the devaluation of the Italian lira began in late 1994, the Vatican
            withdrew his money and reinvested them in US dollars, Japanese yen, British
            pounds and German marks. The Vatican stepped fully into the European
            Economic Monetary System, which was and still is very useful for net capital
            gains of the Holy See.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>
            Reading the statements never published APSA (the body which manages the
            assets of the Apostolic See ) and some confidential notes signed by the new
            president of the IOR Jean Baptist de Franssu, we understand that important part
            of the treasure is hidden right APSA, which unlike the IOR he has never
            announced his accounts. IOR is a real bank without branches, but which administers
            the capital of the religious orders, the institutions of the Church, the dioceses,
            parishes and other Vatican organizations.</paragraph>

      	<title>Gold Recycling</title>
        <chapter>
          <paragraph>
            Gold is the most ductile metals in nature, second only to
            platinum, as well as being an excellent conductor of
            electricity, is widely used in the industries of this sector.
            In fact, with only one gram of yellow metal you can draw
            a wire along more than 3 km, as well as for its inertia and
            resistance is also used in the construction of spacecraft
            and robotics. Pure state gold is incorruptible and will not
            rust, which means that it does not deteriorate when
            attacked by atmospheric agents such as air or water, and
            does not change even when it comes in contact with almost all chemicals.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>
            For all these reasons, gold is also called the eternal metal. For some years now, thanks to
            the economic crisis, many thought that it was useful to monetize through gold mining contained in different
            types of electronic equipment broken or disused.</paragraph>

        <title>What is Happening to Apple?</title>
        <chapter>
          <paragraph>
            Apple has released interesting numbers to understand
            the volume and the number of materials recycled from old
            devices of Apple, properly recovered. In the " spoils"
            there are about 28 thousand tons of steel, aluminum and
            glass. And more than one ton of gold. Worth over 40 million dollars, in addition to the more
            than 10 million of the other materials. According communicates Apple, are about 90 million pounds of
            electronic waste collected through the recycling program,
            71% of the total weight of the products sold by Apple from 7 years to today.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>
            But this isn’t the real news! More likely, it was reported that Apple has recycled “40
            million pounds of electronic waste through its recycling
            program” and much of this waste come from the iPhone and other Apple old products. Of this waste,1 ton of
            them was gold, which, according to current prices, worth
            40 million dollars. Apple has paid independent recyclers to recycle old electronics - and that almost never
            corresponded to Apple products, however - because the law requires you to do so.</paragraph>
