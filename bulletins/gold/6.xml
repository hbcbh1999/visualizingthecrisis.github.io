      <title>Gold: a safe investment</title>
      <chapter>
         <paragraph>
        The investment in gold is one of the most “safe harbors” for all those who
        wish to make of savings operations in the long term.</paragraph>
         <paragraph>
            The use in the precious metal is, however, an equally valid method for those who
            have intentions less conservative and more speculative and assigned to them traders
            the opportunity to invest in the short or very short time.
            The reasons for investing in gold have remained the same throughout history are:
            inﬂation protection, safe haven, high liquidity, diversiﬁcation.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>But how can you invest in gold and be able to take advantage of the bullion price ﬂuctuations?
                 There are two types of gold investment,physical gold and financial gold.
        </paragraph>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <title>Investments in physical gold</title>
         <paragraph>Investing in physical gold, it is to invest in bullion
          or gold coins. The physical value of gold is calculated purely on the gold content.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>The gold coins they buy and sell at a price very close to the official price of gold,
             but it still pays a premium of approximately 4% when they purchase large quantities,
              and 8% when they buy small quantities. Resell the coins involves a similar bonus of 4 to 8%.</paragraph>
              <paragraph>The standard bars from the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA),
                which is the largest trade association that works in the professional bullion
                market, are called Good Delivery bullion and have a minimum purity that is
                acceptable which must have a rate of 99,5% gold. </paragraph>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
        <title>Financial investments in gold</title>>
            <paragraph>The auriferous market offers good opportunities for investment banking and exist in addition
               to the investments in physical gold also many forms of what is deﬁned as a ﬁnancial investment in gold.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>Investing in gold is a ﬁnancial investment that allows
you to be exposed to the price of gold, so to gain or lose depending on the movement
of the physical gold price, but without having to buy physical gold.</paragraph>
<paragraph>From this point of view the investment and more comfortable,
   but it presents the risk that no investment in physical gold.
   The most common tools for investing in gold are ﬁnancial: ETF (Exchange Traded Funds),
    gold Futures, Options on gold, the mining company Shares.
</paragraph>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
        <title>How a bullion arises</title>>
            <paragraph>The gold melting, and the processes that characterize it, have place in
               specialized factories and occur in furnacesin which very high temperatures are developed.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>The ﬁrst step of the process is the fusion of the precious pure material that occurs within
                  particular pots called crucibles and can withstand temperatures in excess of 1000°.</paragraph>
<paragraph>At molten gold are added small quantities of saltpetre and borax,
to avoid issues oxides is in contact with the air. The mixture is introduced into the crucible and then
 in the oven until its liquefaction.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>Once occurred, the product is poured in special molds that will serve
for the production of bullions. Afterwards we will proceed with the export of bullion.
</paragraph>
      </chapter>
    <chapter>
      <title>About physical gold</title>>
          <paragraph>The gold bars are sent to the ofﬁce tests in order to obtain gold certiﬁcates.
            The certiﬁcates conclude the investment banking gold based on large numbers.
In Switzerland and Germany, this practice is widespread, and there are gold certiﬁcates that
give the opportunity to those who invest to own gold without physical delivery of the same.</paragraph>
             <paragraph>The jewelry are not considered an investment but a luxury product.
The process of machining jewelry creates an added value that raises the price.</paragraph>
<paragraph> The gold bullions and gold coins are stored in special vaults
of the big banks. The gold, in both cases, is guarded, numbered
and identiﬁed by the ofﬁcial hallmark.
</paragraph>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
      <title>Different kinds of financial gold investments</title>>
          <paragraph>ETF are funds whose shares are traded on the stock market in real time as shares.
            The transaction costs are lower and the operations are easier.
            However, if there is a ﬁnancial crisis it occurs you do not own
            anything and is not as secure as having physical gold.</paragraph>
             <paragraph>Investments in Shares of mining companies are another way
               to invest in gold. As the price of gold rises, rises the proportion of shares.
               There are risks that can adversely affect the mining stocks.</paragraph>
<paragraph>Futures are ﬁnancial agreements to purchase or sell a speciﬁed quantity of goods for
  which an agreed date and at a price set at the time of the contract.People who invest in futures
  are speculators who take risks for the ‘rise or fall of the price of gold.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>An Option contract is like a futures contract, but has big risks.
  Unlike the futures contract as the future, in option the right to buy or sell
   can be exercised at any time before the option expires.

       <title>Physical gold is hard to find and increases ETF</title>
       <chapter>
          <paragraph>
            Gold could become increasingly difﬁcult metal to buy.
  So if gold prices were to rise, there will be many investors that although would like to buy the metal,
  may not do so and therefore there would be a rise of ETFs and the actions of the extractors.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>Companies have collapsed more than the price of gold and thus we believe that gold
            can be a protection against the uncertainties of economy.

           <paragraph>Most of the analysis provide a bull market throughout 2016.
             So if you want to invest by taking a short-term strategy, we can consider gold being overbought.

      <title>Indian golden traditions</title>
      <chapter>
         <paragraph>
           In India, gold jewellery is a store of value, a symbol of wealth and status and a
           fundamental part of many rituals. In the country’s rural population, a deep affinity
           for gold goes hand in hand with practical considerations of the portability and security
           of jewellery as an investment.</paragraph>
         <paragraph>
             This, explains how India’s appetite for gold defies market
             conditions: despite a 400% rise in the rupee gold price over the last decade,
             gold demand continues to grow.</paragraph>

         <title>Indian Diwali</title>
         <paragraph>
                   Diwali falling between mid-October and mid-November and  is one of the most important
                   dates in the Indian calendar, and as they celebrate, Indians buy gold (around 10 tonnes).
                   India is one of the largest markets for gold jewellery, which has a complex and central role
                   in the country’s cultures.</paragraph>

        <title>Indian marriage</title>
            <paragraph>Gold is central to more personal life events too. Gifting gold is a deeply ingrained part
              of marriage rituals in Indian society, weddings generate approximately 50% of annual gold demand.
              Families begin saving soon after the birth of a girl, and the “Stridhan”, or gift of gold to the bride,
              gives her financial security once she is married.</paragraph>

      <title>Gold as a good omen for the Chinese New Year</title>
      <chapter>
         <paragraph>
           The Chinese New Year is one of the most important and most felt traditional Chinese holidays,
            and celebrates precisely the start of the new year according to the Chinese calendar.</paragraph>
         <paragraph>
             Chinese New Year traditionally marks the period of greatest purchase of gold by individuals.
             Even before the Lunar New Year on 19 February, the gold coins issued by the People's Bank of
             China for the year of the Goat are sold out.</paragraph>
         <paragraph>
                 Even this kind of purchases are a key fact for analysts,
                 intent on research data indicating the extent of demand for gold in the second largest economy
                 in the world. After all, the demand for gold bars, coins and jewelery by individuals in China
                 is equal to one ounce in five sold worldwide in the last five years, second only to India.</paragraph>
