        <chapter>
          <paragraph>

            </paragraph>
            <paragraph> A supply of ingots the mint was Banca Etruria.
               The Institute is the historical supplier of the Mint, which annually buys millions of ingots
               and then turn them into gold tokens for Rai.
            </paragraph>
        </chapter>
        <chapter>
          <paragraph> Maria Cristina Sparanide won 100.000 €, the payout is welded with four gold coin of the unit value
            of 20,000 € eachabout.</paragraph>

            <paragraph> When the winner is changing the amount, it is reduced by another 20,000 €. The winner is aimed at 'Italpreziosi'
               Arezzo to check the winning gold
            </paragraph>
              <paragraph>The gold value of the win is of 995 not of 999, it means that for every pound there are five grams of another
             non-precious material.Ingots are provided by Banca Etruria. Only 20 percent was tested for input, and the result is gold 999.
             So will start the procedures, but the fact remains that 80 per cent has not been checked.</paragraph>

          <title>Italy is among the countries with the most gold in the coffers</title>
          <chapter>
            <paragraph>
            Importantly, the Italian gold is not owned by the government, but the Bank of Italy. In the "vestry"
            of the Koch Palace in Rome it is guarded about half of Italian gold reserves. It has been specified that it is impossible for the Bank
            itself freely dispose of as reserve which is a fundamental defense guarantee for confidence in the country's system.</paragraph>
              <paragraph> . However, considering that the National Bank is part of the 'Eurosystem, the reservations are part and simultaneously
                guarantee along with those of other European countries the system itself.
              </paragraph>
              <paragraph> Currently the reserve is untouchable and unusable, so the possibility of selling
                or the use of a guarantee of public loans are simple impracticable speculation.
              </paragraph>

            <title>Establishment of the gold reserve of the Bank of Italy</title>
            <chapter>
              <paragraph>
                In 1926, in relation to the allocation to the Bank of Italy of the exclusive privilege of issuing power,
                it was ceded to the Institute reserves the Banco di Sicilia and Banco di Napoli, about 70 tons of gold.</paragraph>
              <paragraph>In 1933, total reserves exceeded 561 tons, but the entrance into the war came down to 106 tons;
                 During World War II, the reserves were "looted" from Germany, and returned only in part at the end of the conflict;
                 growth to the current level is widely linked to the Second World War.</paragraph>
              <paragraph>In 1943, the German ordered the transfer of gold reserves at Fort (South Tyrol) 92.3 tons of gold.
                The diminished gold reserves of about 72 tons. In 1946, the "Tripartite Commission for monetary gold return" to countries that
                 had undergone removal by the Nazis assigned to the Bank of Italy about 31.7 tons of the 69 request.</paragraph>
              <paragraph>From 1951 and ultil 1960,the UIC bought large amounts of gold. In 1958 he worked an additional allocation of 12.7 tons.
                The amount officially lost by the Bank, because of the war, was about 25 tons.</paragraph>
              <paragraph>In 1960 and 1965 were implemented by the Office's reserves to those of the Bank of Italy for a total of 1,889 tons,
                according to the principle that the Bank recognized the holding of gold reserves and the management of the UIC currency:
                the gold of the Bank increased to 2,136 tons.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>In 1976, as a result of credit operation performed with the Deutsche Bundesbank on behalf of the UIC,
                  they were relegated to the Office 543 tons.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In July of 1981 there was a very important event in the history of economics Italy,
                     the so-called "Divorce" between the Bank of Italy and the Treasury. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The latest quantitative change, which have led the reserves to the current amounts, took place in 1998 with the definitive transfer
                    of gold held dall'UIC. On January 5, 1999, with the transfer to the ECB of 141 tons of metal.</paragraph>
