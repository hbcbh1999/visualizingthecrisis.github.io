  <title>In the USA, the shale oil and gas dream is over</title>
  <abstract>							                                        <!--[0-1]-->
  In the last years, a lot of oil markets have invested in hydraulic fracturing (fracking). Because of the dropping price of oil, fracking has become too expensive for the USA.

        <title>What Stanford scientist says about fracking</title>
        <paragraph>A Stanford University scientist has found that people who live near shallowly drilled oil and natural gas wells risk drinking water contaminated by methane.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Regions of the USA with this risk include California, parts of Pennsylvania and Texas.</paragraph>

      <text>What Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders thinks about fracking? "We have to regulate what is  currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentions are met.” Bernie Sanders’s answer:“My answer is a lot shorter. No. I do not support fracking.”</text>                                       <!--[ 1 ]-->

      <title>Prevision</title>
      <paragraph>The off-grid solar market has grown to $700 million now from non existent less than a decade ago, according to a report Thursday from the London-based research company and the World Bank Group’s Lighting Global.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>They expect to swell to $3.1 billion by the end of the decade.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Almost 100 million households worldwide may be powered by solar panels by 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.</paragraph>

    <title>The spherical sun power generator</title>
    <paragraph>German Architect Andre Broessel design the spherical sun power generator prototype called the beta.ray.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His technology will combine spherical geometry principles with a dual axis tracking system, allowing twice the yield of a conventional solar panel in a much smaller surface area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The futuristic design is fully rotational and is suitable for inclined surfaces, walls of buildings, and anywhere with access to the sky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It can even be used as an electric car charging station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The beta.ray comes with a hybrid collector to convert daily electricity and thermal energy at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While reducing the silicon cell area to 25% with the equivalent power output by using our ultra transmission Ball Lens point focusing concentrator, it operates at efficiency levels of nearly 57% in hybrid mode.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At nighttime the Ball Lens can transform into a high-power lamp to illuminate your location, simply by using a few LED’s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The station is designed for off grid conditions as well as to supplement buildings’ consumption of electricity and thermal circuits like hot water.”</paragraph>
