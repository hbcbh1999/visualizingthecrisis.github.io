        <title>Coal plants use as much water as 1 billion people and consumption set to double:report</title>                                    <!--[0-1]-->
        <abstract>Non renewables were important investments for long times but now studies on renewables are increasing to save human primary need as water.</abstract>
        <chapter>
          <title>Global Water Stress Map</title>
          <paragraph>Coal power plants use enough water to supply needs of 1 billion of people that will almost double if all the world’s planned power plants come online.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>Almost half the new power plants will be built in areas that are already in high water stress.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>The water usage of each of the world’s 8,359 existing coal power plants and electric plants.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>The research found 44% of current plants, and 45% of planned coal power plants, were in areas that were in a state of water stress, where water use is already considered to be having significant ecosystem impacts.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>That figure was largely driven by China, where most of the world’s coal is used and almost half of the proposed coal fleet was in red-list areas.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>India and Turkey were next, each with 13% of planned coal power stations set to be in red-list areas.</paragraph>

          <title>Global water stress areas</title>
          <paragraph>The agency noted that much of the increase in water use in future would, ironically, be driven by a move towards plants that produced less carbon dioxide.</paragraph>
          <paragraph>The new report found that although coal mining used a significant amount of water, the vast majority from the sector came from energy production, which used 84% of the water.</paragraph>

        <title>Global coal and gas</title>
        <paragraph>Global investment on coal and gas-fired power generation plants fell to less than half that in renewable energy generation last year, in a record year for clean energy.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>For the first time new electric generating capacity renewable energy consists of a majority of renewables sources under development all over the world.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Besides the financial investment on the part of developing countries in renewables it exceeded that of the developed world.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>China alone accounted for 36 % of the global total , as the country it hopes on clean energy as a means of combating air pollution.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Chinese investment rose 17% from 2014 to 2015, totalling $103 billion.</paragraph>

        <title>Rosneft sells stake in oil fields to indian companies amid debt, low oil prices</title>
        <paragraph>Russia’s state-owned oil giant Rosneft signed agreements Wednesday to sell 49.9 percent stakes in two of its Siberian oil fields to four Indian state-run oil companies.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The deals could give over $4 billion to Rosneft, which, amid Western sanctions, is struggling to pay off debts following its $55 billion acquisition of the Russian TNK-BP oil company in 2013.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A consortium of three Indian companies — Oil India, Indian Oil and Bharat PetroResources, a subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum — signed an agreement with Rosneft to buy 23.9 percent stake in the Vankor oilfield for just over $2 billion, Press Trust of India news agency reported.</paragraph>
        <paragraph> Another Indian firm, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, signed an agreement with Rosneft to increase its stake in Vankor to 26 percent from the current 15 percent. According to PTI, the deal was valued at $925 million.</paragraph>

    <title>Hystorical trend of geothermal energy</title>

    <chapter>
      <title>Geothermal power industry</title>
      <paragraph>Geothermal power industry global in 2014 sustained a 5% growth rate for the third year in a row.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The world market reached upwards of 12.8 GW (gigawatts) of geothermal power operational throughout 24 countries.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The majority of this new capacity became operational in Turkey, Kenya, Indonesia, and the Philippines with a total of about 610 MW of new power brought online in 2014.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>As of the end of 2014, there are also 11.5-12.3 GW of capacity additions in 80 countries and 630 projects.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Fourteen of those 80 countries are expected to bring 2 GW of power online over the next 3-4 years based on current construction. </paragraph>
      <paragraph>Looking at projects in the pipeline, it is expected that the geothermal industry will continue to grow at a steady pace globally.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The longer development time frames of geothermal projects make them somewhat more immune to the booms and busts of the global energy space.</paragraph>

      <title>Geothermal developed projects by country</title>
      <paragraph>Geothermal power has continued to heat up in Latin America and several countries have set national geothermal goals.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>For example, El Salvador plans 40% of energy to come from geothermal power by 2020.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Mexico wants to get 35% of its energy from renewables including geothermal power.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Nicaragua plans to build another 100 MW in the next 15 years. Others such as Costa Rica and Guatemala have not set a specific geothermal goal but already have several plants under construction.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>East Africa is another regional hotbed for activity.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Tanzania all have set geothermal power goals.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>While not making the chart below, Ethiopia plans to have an additional 1,000 MW built by the early 2020s; the country’s Corbetti geothermal field, one of the largest in the world, is currently under development. Meanwhile Tanzania plans to build 180 MW over the next few years.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Overall if all countries follow through on their geothermal power goals the global industry could reach 27-30 GW by the early 2030s.</paragraph>
