        <title>The Yellen speech</title>
        <chapter>
            <paragraph>On Tuesday, Janet Yellen—the Federal Reserve womanchair—gave a speech that changed the economy assets for many states. She decided
              to continue with the Dovish strategy, during the second meeting.
              She said the Fed still intended to pursue a careful, patient course toward higher interest rates as the economy improved.
              These words caused reactions to other countries, especially about Asia economy.</paragraph>

          <text>The United States economy remained on track despite a rough start to the year.
            Reflecting global economic and financial developments since December, however,
            the pace of rate increase is now expected to be somewhat slower.</text>

                  Over the past few months, the Chinese economy has been facing liquidity issue, prompting PBOC to conduct money market operation on daily basis.</paragraph>

                    snapped a three day decline after U.S. equities erased their losses for the year, with Yellen indicating

                        <paragraph>Helicopters dropping money it’s a vivid metaphor for a drastic form of central bank stimulus that is gaining attention as a possible way to help the global economy out of its malaise. Helicopter money gets around that dependence on banks. It aims to put the money directly into circulation. It’s supposed to be accompanied with a guarantee that it is a permanent addition to the money supply — unlike quantitative easing, which central banks say they eventually intend to unwind.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Under quantitative easing, central banks buy government bonds from commercial banks. Central banks pay for the bonds by electronically increasing the amounts of money in the accounts that the commercial banks are required to hold at the central bank. When the account balance goes up, new money is created.</paragraph>
