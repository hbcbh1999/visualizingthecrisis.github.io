              <title>What is the future of money?</title>
              <chapter>
                <paragraph>The nature of money changed after the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, when most countries tied the value of their currencies to the US dollar, rather than to gold or silver. When the US went off the gold standard in 1971, all currencies essentially became "fiat moneys," with their value derived from the governments that issue them rather than from commodities.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Central banks can increase or decrease their money supply at will, giving them enormous control over economic activity. In extreme cases, hyperinflation can ensue, debasing the currency and wreaking havoc.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>So it’s not surprising that innovating the concept of money through a digital currency has been a recurring theme in technology circles. Intuitively, it seems that the global financial system should be based on more than the judgments of a small group of central bankers. Yet only recently has digital money actually become possible.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Bitcoin is a digital currency created in 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a white paper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity has yet to be verified. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government issued currencies.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The satoshi is currently the smallest unit of the bitcoin currency recorded on the blockchain. It is a one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC).</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Bitcoin mining is the process of making computer hardware do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network to confirm transactions and increase security. Mining is a specialized and competitive market where the rewards are divided up according to how much calculation is done.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Note that only the first steps involve action by the seller and buyer respectively. The latter are automatically executed by the Bitcoin client software and Bitcoin network. As well, storing the private key attached to an address safely and securely is of the utmost importance; otherwise, anyone who obtains the private key can control the Bitcoins at that address and use them fraudulently.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Forty of the world’s biggest banks, including HSBC
and Citi, have tested a system for trading fixed income
using the technology that underpins bitcoin, fintech
company R3 CEV said on Thursday, March 3th, 2016. The banks are
part of a consortium of 42 major lenders, brought
together last year by New York-based R3 CEV to
work on ways blockchain technology could be used
in financial markets—the first time so many have
collaborated on using such systems.</paragraph>

                <title>This could kill the World’s popular cryptocurrency</title>
                <paragraph>Bitcoin would likely be stopped by the U.S.
government before it became a true currency of use.
It might not even take an institution as large as the US
government to stop Bitcoin. The global decentralized
currency could soon cause its own unwinding.</paragraph>
<paragraph>The problem isn’t that people have stopped using
the service. On the contrary, too many people have
started to use Bitcoin, and as a result, the payment
system is jammed up. Instead of processing payments
quickly, it’s taking hours in some cases. Tens of
thousands of unprocessed transactions are in queue,
and vendors that had accepted Bitcoin are starting
to drop out.</paragraph>

Ex-Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges was sentenced to nearly six years in federal prison after pleading guilty last year to money laundering and obstruction charges tied to the theft of more than $800,000 in bitcoin from the Silk Road during the US government’s investigation.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>While Russian authorities and regulators take a notoriously hardline stance against Bitcoin, the country’s central bank has announced the establishment of a ‘working group’ that will seek to study distributed ledger or blockchain technology, the same underlying technology that powers Bitcoin.
The Working Group will schedule regular meetings that will be attended by representatives of banks, financial market leaders and participants as well as self-regulating organizations that will convene to discuss the different aspects of the application and use of blockchain technology and Fintech.
Russia’s central bank joins the blockchain bandwagon in the months after Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank by assets, also revealed its intention to join the private banking blockchain consortium led by New York-based R3, toward the end of 2015.</paragraph>

              <chapter>
                <title>Blockchain</title>
                <paragraph>Blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin transactions. It essentially works as a global and public ledger.
Information is stored on a distributed network of computers, there’s no central database that can be tampered with or hacked.
Every 10 minutes, all transactions are recorded in a virtual block, and a new block is created, linked to all
the previous blocks in the chain. The blocks are visible to both parties involved in the transaction.
All of which makes it a system well-suited for storing and sharing accounts.</paragraph>
              </chapter>
              <chapter>
                <title>Blocks</title>
                <paragraph>Transaction data is permanently recorded in files called blocks. Blocks are organized into a linear
sequence over time (block chain). New transactions are constantly being processes by miners into
new blocks which are added to the end of the chain and can never be changed or removed once accepted by the network.</paragraph>
              </chapter>
              <chapter>
                <title>Orphan blocks</title>
                <paragraph>Blocks in shorter chains (or invalid chains) are not used for anything.
When the bitcoin client switches to another, longer chain, all valid transactions of the blocks inside the shorter chain are re-added to the pool of queued transactions and will be included in another block.</paragraph>
              </chapter>
              <chapter>
                <title>Proof of work</title>
                <paragraph>Dividing the ledger up into distributed blocks isn’t enough on its own to protect the ledger from fraud. Bitcoin also relies on cryptography. The computational problem is different for every block in the chain, and it involves a particular kind of algorithm called a hash function.</paragraph>
