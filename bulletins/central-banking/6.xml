          <title>What is a bond?</title>
          <paragraph>A bond is a debt investment in which an investor loans money to an entity which borrows the funds for a defined period of time at a variable or fixed interest rate. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states and sovereign governments to raise money and finance a variety of projects and activities. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer.</paragraph>

        <title>The cost of tax evasion</title>
        <chapter>
          <paragraph>According to The Hidden Wealth of Nations, a recent book by University of California, Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, the answer is that tax evasion costs governments approximately $200 billion per year. Zucman also estimates that tax avoidance by U.S. corporations—which, unlike tax evasion, is generally carried out in the open and is technically legal—costs governments an additional $130 billion per year.</paragraph>

          <text>Tax havens are one of the prime reasons why inequality is rising and may continue to rise. If we want to deal it and rising wealth concentration seriously, then we need to make these forms of tax dodging much, much more limited.</text>

          <paragraph>Those offshore holdings helped lower the combined effective global-tax rate for those companies from 35%, the rate US corporations are required to pay on their profits, to 27%, according to the report.</paragraph>
